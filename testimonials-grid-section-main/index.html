        <h3 class="text-white"><b>I received a job offer mid-course, and the subjects I learned were current, 
        if not more so, in the company I joined. I honestly feel I got every penny’s 
        worth.</b></h3>
        <p class="texto-purple">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
        I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
        people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
        thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
        life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
        working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

    Jeanette Harmon Verified Graduate An overall wonderful and
    rewarding experience “ Thank you for the wonderful experience! I now have a
    job I really enjoy, and make a good living while doing something I love. ”
    Patrick Abrams Verified Graduate Awesome teaching support from TAs who did
    the bootcamp themselves. Getting guidance from them and learning from their
    experiences was easy. “ The staff seem genuinely concerned about my progress
    which I find really refreshing. The program gave me the confidence necessary
    to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
    developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
    attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.
    ” Kira Whittle Verified Graduate Such a life-changing experience. Highly
    recommended! “ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
    code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
    programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
    theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
    curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
    had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
    outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
    could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
    example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
    full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”
