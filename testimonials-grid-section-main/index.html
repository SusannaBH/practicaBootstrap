        <p class="texto-purple">“ I was an EMT for many years before I joined the bootcamp.
        I’ve been looking to make a transition and have heard some
        people who had an amazing experience here. I signed up for
        the free intro course and found it incredibly fun! I enrolled shortly
        thereafter. The next 12 weeks was the best - and most grueling - time of my
        life. Since completing the course, I’ve successfully switched careers,
        working as a Software Engineer at a VR startup. ”</p>

        to be able to go out in the world and present myself as a capable junior
        developer. The standard is above the rest. You will get the personal
        attention you need from an incredible community of smart and amazing people.”</p>

        <p class="text-secondary">“ Before joining the bootcamp, I’ve never written a line of
        code. I needed some structure from professionals who can help me learn
        programming step by step. I was encouraged to enroll by a former student of
        theirs who can only say wonderful things about the program. The entire
        curriculum and staff did not disappoint. They were very hands-on and I never
        had to wait long for assistance. The agile team project, in particular, was
        outstanding. It took my learning to the next level in a way that no tutorial
        could ever have. In fact, I’ve often referred to it during interviews as an
        example of my developent experience. It certainly helped me land a job as a
        full-stack developer after receiving multiple offers. 100% recommend! ”</p>
